# Buildpacks

## Building a container image with Buildpacks and Spring Boot

```shell
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

Run the containerized application with Podman

```shell
podman run --rm -p 8080:8080 buildpacks:1.0.0
```

Test the application is working correctly

```shell
http :8080
```

Browse the SBOMs generated by Buildpacks for each image using [httpie](https://httpie.io) or from the browser.

```shell
http :8080/actuator/sbom
```

## Extracting the SBOMs from each layer of the image with pack

You can use the [pack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack) CLI from the Cloud Native Buildpacks project to extract the SBOMs from each layer of the image.

```shell
pack sbom download buildpacks:1.0.0 --output-dir image-sboms
```
